### NEXT STEPS
# Start by making video with Einstein quotes:
#   i) find free text-to-speech software which allows music in the background
#  ii) choose a voice + background music
# iii) make the video; don't worry about the visual aspect of the video for now
#  iv) create a mock YouTube channel. Don't worry about name / logo / branding; I will delete the channel afterwards
#   v) load the video to YouTube channel


# i) OBS Studio to screen record Google Slides with Quotes
# ii) Davinci Resolve to edit the screen recording video (e.g. to trim the beginning / end of video, which will include navigating to/from the Google Slides)
# iii) Use Murf.ai to record the audio (i.e. AI reading the quotes)
