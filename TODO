### NEXT STEPS
# Start by making mock video using Abraham Lincoln slideshow I started. Test the placing of the quote + author, i.e. how it will look on YouTube
    (will it be covered by the video progress bar? Will it cover the clickable icon in the bottom right which could steer users to homepage?)
# i) make video without audio
    * use OBS Studio to screen record Google Slides where each slide = 1 quote
    * Use Davinci Resolve to edit the screen-recording (e.g. trim the beginning/end of video; make each slide the same length of time)
# ii) Use murf.ai to record the audio for the video, i.e. both reading the quotes + background music (https://murf.ai/voice-over-video)
# iii) Load video to YouTube channel



# Choose a YouTube channel name
# Choose a YouTube channel logo
# Find a cool consistent design for each slideshow:
    * how will quotes be displayed?
    * which font for quotes
    * color of background?
    * location of author's image on screen (fortunately they are always the same size in Quotes.csv)
# Find a voice from murf.ai that will be used. (Will it always be the same? Maybe choose one for men, one for women)
# Find background music from murf.ai that will be used. (Will it always be the same?)
