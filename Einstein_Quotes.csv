25,It is strange to be known so universally and yet to be so lonely.

10,True knowledge comes with deep understanding of a topic and its inner workings.
98,"Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler. A man should look for what is, and not for what he thinks should be. We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them. A question that sometimes drives me hazy: am I or are the others crazy? Any intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex... It takes a touch of genius - and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction. All religions, arts and sciences are branches of the same tree. It's not that I'm so smart, it's just that I stay with problems longer."

No myth is filled with such life...Theseus and other heroes of his type lack the authentic vitality of Jesus."
42,I'm not an atheist. I don't think I can call myself a pantheist. The problem involved is too vast for our limited minds. We are in the position of a little child entering a huge library filled with books in many languages. The child knows someone must have written those books.
110,"Modern education is competitive, nationalistic and separative. It has trained the child to regard material values as of major importance, to believe that his nation is also of major importance and superior to other nations and peoples. The general level of world information is high but usually biased, influenced by national prejudices, serving to make us citizens of our nation but not of the world."
76,There's a genius in all of us.
64,"I am a stronger follower of Veganism by principle, not just because of moral and aesthetic reasons.

However, hatred then leads to persecution when the might of the majority is behind it."

5,"Everyone likes me, yet nobody understands me."
105,"I cannot conceive of a God who rewards and punishes his creatures, or has a will of the kind that we experience in ourselves. Neither can I nor would I want to conceive of an individual that survives his physical death; let feeble souls, from fear or absurd egoism, cherish such thoughts. I am satisfied with the mystery of the eternity of life and with the awareness and a glimpse of the marvelous structure of the existing world, together with the devoted striving to comprehend a portion, be it ever so tiny, of the Reason that manifests itself in nature."

31,"Human beings can attain a worthy and harmonious life only if they are able to rid themselves, within the limits of human nature, of the striving for the wish fulfillment of material kinds. The goal is to raise the spiritual values of society."
41,"The ideals which have always shone before me and filled me with the joy of living are goodness, beauty, and truth. To make a goal of comfort or happiness has never appealed to me; a system of ethics built on this basis would be sufficient only for a herd of cattle."

15,The most important decision we make is whether we believe we live in a friendly or hostile universe.
5,"The facts, although interesting, are irrelevant."
15,I am also convinced that one gains the purest joy from spirited things only when they are not tied in with earning one's livelihood.

65,"From the standpoint of daily life, however, there is one thing we do know: that we are here for the sake of each other - above all for those upon whose smile and well-being our own happiness depends, and also for the countless unknown souls with whose fate we are connected by a bond of sympathy.

Life and death are fused together and there is no evolution, nor destination, there is only BEING."

11,"If the moon, in the act of completing its eternal way around the earth, were gifted with self-consciousness, it would feel thoroughly convinced that it was traveling its way of its own accord on the strength of a resolution taken once and for all.

 other efforts."

50,"I cannot conceive of a personal God who would directly influence the actions of individuals, or would directly sit in judgment on creatures of his own creation. I cannot do this in spite of the fact that mechanistic causality has, to a certain extent, been placed in doubt by modern science. My religiosity consists in a humble admiration of the infinitely superior spirit that reveals itself in the little that we, with our weak and transitory understanding, can comprehend of reality. Morality is of the highest importance - but for us, not for God."

44,"The ideals which have lighted my way, and time after time have given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been Kindness, Beauty, and Truth. Without the sense of kinship with men of like mind, without the occupation with the objective world, the eternally unattainable in the field of art and scientific endeavors, life would have seemed to the empty. The trite objects of human efforts — possessions, outward success, luxury—have always seemed to me contemptible."

23,Teaching should be such that what is offered is perceived as a valuable gift and not as a hard duty.
17,It is abhorrent to me when a fine intelligence is paired with an unsavory character.
12,"The history of scientific and technical discovery teaches us that the human race is poor in independent and creative imagination. Even when the external and scientific requirements for the birth of an idea have long been there, it generally needs an external stimulus to make it actually happen; man has, so to speak, to stumble right up against the thing before the idea comes."
3,The normal objective of my thought affords no insight into the dark places of human will and feeling.

69,When forced to summarize the general theory of relativity in one sentence: Time and space and gravitation have no separate existence from matter.
12,I learned many years ago never to waste time trying to convince my colleagues.
13,"""There's been a quantum leap technologically in our age, but unless there's another quantum leap in human relations, unless we learn to live in a new way towards one another, there will be a catastrophe."""
57,"He who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead; his eyes are closed."
13,I have come to know the mutability of all human relationships and have learned to insulate myself against both heat and cold so that a temperature balance is fairly well assured.
62,"It is, in fact, nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of instruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry; for this delicate little plant, aside from stimulation, stands mainly in need of freedom; without this it goes to wrack and ruin without fail. It is a grave mistake to think that the enjoyment of seeing and searching can be promoted by means of coercion and a sense of duty."
37,It is a miracle that curiosity survives formal education.
27,Anger dwells only in the bosom of fools.
71,The pursuit of truth and beauty is a sphere of activity in which we are permitted to remain children all our lives.
22,"There is nothing divine about morality; it is a purely human affair. If people are good only because they fear punishment, and hope for reward, then we are a sorry lot indeed. What the individual can do is to give a fine example, and to have the courage to uphold ethical values .. in a society of cynics."
115,Nationalism is an infantile disease. It is the measles of mankind.
23,Everything that can be counted does not necessarily count; everything that counts cannot necessarily be counted.
19,"The pursuit of knowledge for its own sake, an almost fanatical love of justice and the desire for personal independence -- these are the features of the Jewish tradition which make me thank my stars that I belong to it."
12,The most aggravating thing about the younger generation is that I no longer belong to it.
54,It almost seems to me that man was not born to be a carnivore.
7,"It is difficult to say what truth is, but sometimes it is so easy to recognize a falsehood."
15,I assert that the cosmic religious experience is the strongest and the noblest driving force behind scientific research.
20,Genius is when an idea and the execution of that idea are simultaneous.
23,"America is a democracy and has no Hitler, but I am afraid for her future; there are hard times ahead for the American people, troubles will be coming from within and without. America cannot smile away their Negro problem nor Hiroshima and Nagasaki. There are cosmic laws."
6,"In two weeks the sheeplike masses of any country can be worked up by the newspapers into such a state of excited fury that men are prepared to put on uniforms and kill and be killed, for the sake of the sordid ends of a few interested parties. Compulsory military service seems to me the most disgraceful symptom of that deficiency in personal dignity from which civilized mankind is suffering today."
30,"Matter is real to my senses, but they aren't trustworthy. If Galileo or Copernicus had accepted what they saw, they would never have discovered the movement of the earth and planets."
127,The only thing that interferes with my learning is my education.
34,True art is characterized by an irresistible urge in the creative artist.
8,"I do not at all believe in human freedom in the philosophical sense... Schopenhauer’s saying, ‘A man can do what he wants, but not will what he wants,’ has been a very real inspiration to me since my youth; it has been a continual consolation in the face of life’s hardships, my own and others’, and an unfailing wellspring of tolerance. This realization mercifully mitigates the easily paralyzing sense of responsibility and prevents us from taking ourselves and other people too seriously; it is conducive to a view of life which, in part, gives humour its due."
19,I want to know all Gods thoughts; all the rest are just details.
20,"That which is impenetrable to us really exists. Behind the secrets of nature remains something subtle, intangible, and inexplicable. Veneration for this force beyond anything that we can comprehend is my religion."
5,"One lives one's life under constant tension, until it's time to go for good"
23,"Art is standing with one hand extended into the universe and one hand extended into the world, and letting ourselves be a conduit for passing energy."
9,I didn't arrive at my understanding of the fundamental laws of the universe through my rational mind.
26,God is subtle but he is not malicious.
40,Teaching should be such that what is offered is perceived as a valuable gift and not as hard duty. Never regard study as duty but as the enviable opportunity to learn to know the liberating influence of beauty in the realm of the spirit for your own personal joy and to the profit of the community to which your later work belongs.
52,"My feeling is religious insofar as I am imbued with the consciousness of the insufficiency of the human mind to understand more deeply the harmony of the Universe which we try to formulate as ""laws of nature""."
12,"In any conflict between humanity and technology, humanity will win."
86,"That deep emotional conviction of the presence of a superior reasoning power, which is revealed in the incomprehensible universe, forms my idea of God."
24,"When I was young I found out that the big toe always ends up making a hole in a sock. 
 So I stopped wearing socks."
107,"Intellectuals solve problems, geniuses prevent them."
13,"God is clever, but not dishonest."
14,Never lose a holy curiosity. Try not to become a man of success but rather try to become a man of value. He is considered successful in our day who gets more out of life than he puts in. But a man of value will give more than he receives.
10,All of us who are concerned for peace and triumph of reason and justice must be keenly aware how small an influence reason and honest good will exert upon events in the political field.
23,"I have never belonged wholeheartedly to country or State, to my circle of friends or even to my own family... Such isolation is sometimes bitter, but I do not regret being cut off from the understanding and sympathy of other men. I lose something by it,to be sure, but I am compensated for it in being rendered independent of the customs, opinions and prejudices of others, and am not tempted to rest my peace of mind upon such shifting foundations."
16,We know nothing at all. All our knowledge is but the knowledge of schoolchildren. The real nature of things we shall never know.
44,"The indifference, callousness and contempt that so many people exhibit toward animals is evil first because it results in great suffering in animals, and second because it results in an incalculably great impoverishment of the human spirit."
45,Imagination is everything. It is the preview of life's coming attractions.
23,"The religious geniuses of all ages have been distinguished by this kind of religious feeling, which knows no dogma and no God conceived in man's image; so that there can be no church whose central teachings are based on it. Hence it is precisely among the heretics of every age that we find men who were filled with this highest kind of religious feeling and were in many cases regarded by their contemporaries as atheists, sometimes also as saints. Looked at in this light, men like Democritus, Francis of Assisi, and Spinoza are closely akin to one another."
84,Everything that is really great and inspiring is created by the individual who can labor in freedom.
12,"It is not a lack of real affection that scares me away again and again from marriage. Is it a fear of the comfortable life, of nice furniture, of dishonor that I burden myself with, or even the fear of becoming a contented bourgeois."
19,We must be prepared to make the same heroic sacrifices for the cause of peace that we make ungrudgingly for the cause of war.
26,"I think and think for months and years. Ninety-nine times, the conclusion is false. The hundredth time I am right."
57,"We should take care not to make the intellect our god; it has, of course, powerful muscles, but no personality."
28,"Arrows of hate have been aimed at me too, but they have never hit me, because somehow they belonged to another world with which I have no connection whatsoever."
11,All these constructions and the laws connecting them can be arrived at by the principle of looking for the mathematically simplest concepts and the link between them.
16,The high destiny of the individual is to serve rather than to rule.
7,A tyranny based on ... deception and maintained by terror must inevitably perish from the poison it generates within itself.
22,"Human beings, vegetables, or cosmic dust, we all dance to a mysterious tune, intoned in the distance by an invisible piper."
8,The armament industry is indeed one of the greatest dangers that beset mankind. It is the hidden evil power.
6,"I don't teach my students, I provide the circumstances in which they can learn."
28,"The real difficulty, the difficulty which has baffled the sages of all times, is rather this: how can we make our teaching so potent in the motional life of man, that its influence should withstand the pressure of the elemental psychic forces in the individual?"
10,"I should much rather see reasonable agreement with the Arabs on the basis of living together in peace than the creation of a Jewish state. My awareness of the essential nature of Judaism resists the idea of a Jewish state with borders, an army, and a measure of temporal power, no matter how modest. I am afraid of the inner damage Judaism will sustain—especially from the development of a narrow nationalism within our own ranks, against which we have already had to fight strongly, even without a Jewish state."
9,Everything what's inspiring has been created by one who could work in freedom
27,Mozart's music is so pure and beautiful that I see it as a reflection of the inner beauty of the universe.
49,My religion consists of a humble admiration of the illimitable superior spirit who reveals himself in the slight details we are able to perceive with our frail and feeble mind.
9,Games are the most elevated form of investigation.
19,"The further the spiritual evolution of mankind advances, the more certain it seems to me that the path to genuine religiosity does not lie through the fear of life, and the fear of death, and blind faith, but through striving after rational knowledge."
8,Don't become a seeker of success. Become a person of value.
74,Women marry men hoping they will change. Men marry women hoping they will not.
33,"Reading, after a certain age, diverts the mind too much from its creative pursuits. Any man who reads too much and uses his own brain too little falls into lazy habits of thinking."
14,I thought of that while riding my bicycle.
56,"Each of us is here for a brief sojourn; for what purpose
he knows not, though he sometimes thinks he senses it.
But without deeper reflection one knows from daily life
that one exists for other people."
17,"Whatever there is of God and goodness in the universe, it must work itself out and express itself through us. We cannot stand aside and let God do it."
33,All that is valuable in human society depends upon the opportunity for development accorded the individual.
10,"Compound interest on debt was the banker's greatest invention, to capture, and enslave, a productive society."
14,"Scientific research is based on the idea that everything that takes place is determined by laws of Nature, and therefore this holds for the action of people. For this reason, a research scientist will hardly be inclined to believe that events could be influenced by a prayer, i.e. by a wish addressed to a Supernatural Being."
25,"I am not a positivist. Positivism states that what cannot be observed does not exist. This conception is scientifically indefensible, for it is impossible to make valid affirmations of what people 'can' or 'cannot' observe. One would have to say 'only what we observe exists,' which is obviously false."
8,"The years of searching in the dark for a truth that one feels but cannot express, the intense desire and the alternations of confidence and misgiving until one breaks through to clarity and understanding, are known only to him who has experienced them himself."
11,"I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils, namely through the establishment of a socialist economy, accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals."
17,Feeling and longing are the motive forces behind all human endeavor and human creations.
11,Work is the only thing that gives substance to life.
8,"Innovation is not the product of logical thought, even though the final product is tied to a logical structure."
12,"The development of general ability for independent thinking and judgment should always be placed foremost, not the acquisition of special knowledge."
16,In a sailboat I become oblivious to everything else in the world.
16,A life directed chiefly toward the fulfillment of personal desires will sooner or later always lead to bitter disappointment.
9,You can never solve a problem on the level on which it was created.
31,"Body and soul are not two different things, but only two different ways of perceiving the same thing. Similarly, physics and psychology are only different attempts to link our experiences together by way of systematic thought."
18,"Everyone sits in the prison of his own ideas; he must burst it open, and that in his youth, and so try to test his ideas on reality."
13,"Desire for approval and recognition is a healthy motive, but the desire to be acknowledged as better, stronger, or more intelligent than a fellow being or fellow scholar easily leads to an excessively egoistic psychological adjustment, which may become injurious for the individual and for the community."
4,Play is the highest from of research.
118,Weakness of attitude becomes weakness of character.
20,"It's not that life has been easy, perfect or exactly as expected. I just choose to be happy and grateful no matter how it all turns out. If people are good only because they fear punishment, and hope for reward, then we are a sorry lot indeed."
20,"I believe, indeed, that overemphasis on the purely intellectual attitude, often directed solely to the practical and factual, in our education, has led directly to the impairment of ethical values."
37,"[Max Planck] was one of the finest people I have ever known... but he really didn't understand physics, [because] during the eclipse of 1919 he stayed up all night to see if it would confirm the bending of light by the gravitational field. If he had really understood [general relativity], he would have gone to bed the way I did"
36,Few people are capable of expressing with equanimity opinions which differ from the prejudices of their social environment. Most people are even incapable of forming such opinions.
69,"If you are out to describe the truth, leave elegance to the tailor."
23,Everybody should be ashamed who uses the wonders of science and engineering without thinking and having mentally realized not more of it than a cow realizes of the botany of the plants which it eats with pleasure.
76,What a sad era when it is easier to smash an atom than a prejudice.
19,My mind is my laboratory.
32,Memory is deceptive because it is colored by today's events.
387,"The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery every day. Never lose a holy curiosity."
37,We still do not know one thousandth of one percent of what nature has revealed to us.
19,But love brings much happiness - much more so than pining brings pain.
94,It gives me great pleasure indeed to see the stubbornness of an incorrigible nonconformist warmly acclaimed.
38,It is every man's obligation to put back into the world at least the equivalent of what he takes out of it.
30,It is harder to crack prejudice than an atom.
10,The wonder of nature does not become smaller because one cannot measure it by the standards of human moral and human aims.
91,The gift of fantasy has meant more to me than my talent for absorbing positive knowledge.
28,"A perfection of means, and confusion of aims, seems to be our main problem."
12,"I do not play games. There is not time for it. When I get through with work, I don't want anything that requires the working of the mind."
10,"External conditions can, to a certain extent, reduce, but never cancel individual repsonsibility."
13,"I want to go when I want. It is tasteless to prolong life artificially. I have done my share, it is time to go. I will do it elegantly."
21,"For an idea that does not first seem insane, there is no hope."
19,"Given the millions of billions of Earth-like planets, life elsewhere in the Universe without a doubt, does exist. In the vastness of the Universe we are not alone."
115,Any man who can drive safely while kissing a pretty girl is simply not giving the kiss the attention it deserves.
23,"While I am a convinced pacifist there are circumstances in which I believe the use of force is appropriate - namely, in the face of an enemy unconditionally bent on destroying me and my people."
17,"I was sitting in a chair in the patent office at Bern when all of a sudden a thought occurred to me: ""If a person falls freely he will not feel his own weight."" I was startled. This simple thought made a deep impression on me. It impelled me toward a theory of gravitation."
6,Marriage is but slavery made to appear civilized.
20,"Keep on sowing your seed, for you never know which will grow - perhaps it all will."
16,"I am an adherent of the ideal of democracy, although I well know the weaknesses of the democratic form of government. Social equality and economic protection of the individual appeared to me always as the important communal aims of the state. Although I am a typical loner in daily life, my consciousness of belonging to the invisible community of those who strive for truth, beauty, and justice has preserved me from feeling isolated."
30,"A person experiences life as something separated from the rest - a kind of optical delusion of consciousness. Our task must be to free ourselves from this self-imposed prison, and through compassion, to find the reality of Oneness."
31,"Creating a new theory is not like destroying an old barn and erecting a skyscraper in its place. It is rather like climbing a mountain, gaining new and wider views, discovering unexpected connections between our starting points and its rich environment. But the point from which we started out still exists and can be seen, although it appears smaller and forms a tiny part of our broad view gained by the mastery of the obstacles on our adventurous way up."
13,"There are moments when one feels free from one's own identification with human limitations and inadequacies. At such moments one imagines that one stands on some spot of a small planet, gazing in amazement at the cold yet profoundly moving beauty of the eternal, the unfathomable; life and death flow into one, and there is neither evolution nor destiny; only Being."
3,I have also considered many scientific plans during my pushing you around in your pram!
7,The illusion that we are separate from one another is an optical delusion of our consciousness.
63,"We owe a lot to the Indians, who taught us how to count, without which no worthwhile scientific discovery could have been made."
15,It is my inner conviction that the development of science seeks in the main to satisfy the longing for pure knowledge.
6,"Children don’t heed the life experiences of their parents, and nations ignore history. Bad lessons always have to be learned anew."
27,Laws alone can not secure freedom of expression; in order that every man present his views without penalty there must be spirit of tolerance in the entire population.
26,"Bear in mind that the wonderful things you learn in your schools are the work of many generations. All this is put in your hands as your inheritance in order that you may receive it, honor it, add to it, and one day faithfully hand it on to your children."
11,"When I was a fairly precocious young man I became thoroughly impressed with the futility of the hopes and strivings that chase most men restlessly through life. Moreover, I soon discovered the cruelty of that chase, which in those years was much more carefully covered up by hypocrisy and glittering words than is the case today. By the mere existence of his stomach everyone was condemned to participate in that chase. The stomach might well be satisfied by such participation, but not man insofar as he is a thinking and feeling being."
10,"When a man is sufficiently motivated, discipline will take care of itself."
10,Nothing truly valuable can be achieved except by the unselfish cooperation of many individuals.
15,The Bible is a great source of wisdom and consolation and should be read frequently.
29,Time and space are modes by which we think and not conditions in which we live.
45,"An oligarchy of private capital cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized political society because under existing conditions, private capitalists inevitably control, directly or indirectly, the main sources of information."
58,We shall require a substantially new manner of thinking if mankind is to survive.
17,The most incomprehensible thing about the world is that it is comprehensible.
9,Weakness of attitude becomes weakness of character; it becomes lack of power to act with courage proportionate to danger. All this must lead to the destruction of our intellectual life unless the danger summons up strong personalities able to fill the lukewarm and discouraged with new strength and resolution.
8,I am not an atheist. I do not know if I can define myself as a pantheist. The problem involved is too vast for our limited minds.
9,"I find it difficult to believe that I belong to such an idiotic, rotten species - the species that actually boasts of its freedom of will, heroism on command, senseless violence, and all of the loathsome nonsense that goes by the name of patriotism."
12,One who scorns the power of intuition will never rise above the ranks of journeyman calculator.
14,Never memorize something that you can look up.
17,Most teachers waste their time by asking question which are intended to discover what a pupil does not know whereas the true art of questioning has for its purpose to discover what pupils knows or is capable of knowing.
11,"For me a simple message, to think and act with courage, independence and imagination."
6,"It is intelligent to have a plan, but neurotic to fall in love with it."
11,"One reason why mathematics enjoys special esteem,above all other sciences,is
 that its laws are absolutely certain and indisputable,while those of all
 other sciences are to some extent debatable and in constant danger of being
 overthrown by newly discovered facts."
8,"Private capitalists inevitably control, directly or indirectly, the main sources of information. It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights."
11,Is it not a terrible thing to be forced by society to do things which all of us as individuals regard as abominable crimes?
7,"Communities tend to be guided less than individuals by conscience and a sense of responsibility. How much misery does this fact cause mankind! It is the source of wars and every kind of oppression, which fill the earth with pain, sighs and bitterness."
56,"My life is a simple thing that would interest no one. It is a known fact that I was born, and that is all that is necessary."
12,"It is only men who are free, who create the inventions and intellectual works which to us moderns make life worth while."
16,Only the one who does not question is safe from making a mistake.
12,All I want to do is learn to think like God.  All the rest is just details.
7,"If I can't picture it, I can't understand it."
16,The led must not be compelled; they must be able to choose their own leader.
23,"As I have said so many times, God doesn't play dice with the world."
14,"In the view of such harmony in the cosmos which I, with my limited human mind, am able to recognize, there are yet people who says there is no God. But what makes me really angry is that they quote me for support of such views. (The Expanded Quotable Einstein, Princeton University, page 214)"
16,If most of us are ashamed of shabby clothes and shoddy furniture let us be more ashamed of shabby ideas and shoddy philosophies.
8,The value of a man should be seen in what he gives and not in what he is able to receive.
69,"We experience ourselves our thoughts and feelings as something separate from the rest. A kind of optical delusion of consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us."
16,Compounding is the 8th wonder of the world.
9,I want to be cremated so people won't come to worship at my bones.
17,Art is the expression of the profoundest thoughts in the simplest way.
9,You have to color outside the lines once in a while if you want to make your life a masterpiece.
37,An empty stomach is not a good political adviser.
9,Education is what is left after you've forgotten everything you've learned.
3,"Many a young lady does not realize just how strong her love for a young man is until he fails to pass the approval test with her parents. There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear. Of all forms of caution, caution in love is the most fatal. There are only two truly infinite things, the universe and stupidity. And I am unsure about the universe."
7,Nothing in the world makes people so afraid as the influence of independent-minded people.
6,"Indeed, it is not intellect, but intuition which advances humanity. Intuition tells man his purpose in this life."
3,Only strong characters can resist the temptation of superficial analysis.
3,"Do things sound better in your head before you say them, or do you even run them through there first?"
3,"I simply imagine it so, then go about to prove it."
13,Experience alone can decide on truth.
13,"Common to all these types is the anthropomorphic character of their conception of God. In general, only individuals of exceptional endowments, and exceptionally high-minded communities, rise to any considerable extent above this level. But there is a third stage of religious experience which belongs to all of them, even though it is rarely found in a pure form: I shall call it cosmic religious feeling. It is very difficult to elucidate this feeling to anyone who is entirely without it, especially as there is no anthropomorphic conception of God corresponding to it."
10,"The more I learn of physics, the more I am drawn to metaphysics."
10,"The harmony of natural law reveals an Intelligence of such superiority that, compared with it, all the systematic thinking and acting of human beings is an utterly insignificant reflection."
21,"Hunger, love, pain, fear are some of those inner forces which rule the individual's instinct for self preservation."
6,"Your ancestors dragged these black people from their homes by force; and in the white man's quest for wealth and an easy life they have been ruthlessly suppressed and exploited, degraded into slavery. The modern prejudice against Negroes is the result of the desire to maintain this unworthy condition."
17,You cannot love a car the way you love a horse. The horse brings out human feelings the way machines cannot do. Things like machines may develop or neglect certain things in people ... Machines make our life impersonal and stultify certain elements in us and create an impersonal environment.
87,No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong.
94,Common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen.

14,"Time and space are not conditions of existence, time and space is a model for thinking"
18,"I soon learned to scent out that which was able to lead to fundamentals and to turn aside from everything else, from the multitude of things which clutter up the mind and divert it from the essential."
11,"The more success the quantum theory has, the sillier it looks"
7,"The state exists for man, not man for the state. The same may be said of science. These are old phrases, coined by people who saw in human individuality the highest human value. I would hesitate to repeat them, were it not for the ever recurring danger that they may be forgotten, especially in these days of organization and stereotypes."
12,"Strenuous intellectual work and the study of God's Nature are the angels that will lead me through all the troubles of this life with consolation, strength, and uncompromising rigor."
25,A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. So is a lot.
6,Humiliation and mental oppression by ignorant and selfish teachers wreak havoc in the youthful mind that can never be undone and often exert a baleful influence in later life.
10,I am satisfied with the mystery of the eternity of life.
5,"When the Special Theory of Relativity began to germinate in me, I was visited by all sorts of nervous conflicts... I used to go away for weeks in a state of confusion."
17,"I have tried 99 times and have failed, but on the 100th time came success."
7,Common sense is that layer of prejudices which we acquire before we are sixteen.
9,It is high time the ideal of success should be replaced with the ideal of service.
32,If you do the same thing over and over again you cannot ever expect a different outcome.
27,Problems cannot be solved by thinking within the framework in which the problems were created.
14,The most powerful force in the world is compound interest.
8,People love chopping wood. In this activity one immediately sees results.
27,Sometimes one pays most for the things one gets for nothing.
16,"I agree with your remark about loving your enemy as far as actions are concerned. But for me the cognitive basis is the trust in an unrestricted causality. 'I cannot hate him, because he must do what he does.' That means for me more Spinoza than the prophets."
30,"The future is of greater interest to me than the past, since that is where I intend to spend the rest of my life."
11,The Universe is stranger than we imagine!
14,"Without changing our pattern of thought, we will not be able to solve the problems we created with our current patterns of thought"
18,"... a person who is religiously enlightened appears to me to be one who has, to the best of his ability, liberated himself from the fetters of his selfish desires and is preoccupied with thoughts, feelings, and aspirations to which he clings because of their superpersonal value."
104,God does not play dice.
13,Time is an illusion.
24,The chicken did not cross the road. The road passed beneath the chicken.
43,"After a certain high level of technical skill is achieved science and art tend to coalesce in aesthetics, plasticity, and form. The greatest scientists are artists as well."
62,"It seems to me that the idea of a personal God is an anthropological concept which I cannot take seriously. I also cannot imagine some will or goal outside the human sphere... Science has been charged with undermining morality, but the charge is unjust. A man's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties and needs; no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death."
24,"I do not believe in free will. Schopenhauer's words: 'Man can do what he wants, but he cannot will what he wills,' accompany me in all situations throughout my life and reconcile me with the actions of others, even if they are rather painful to me. This awareness of the lack of free will keeps me from taking myself and my fellow men too seriously as acting and deciding individuals, and from losing my temper."
107,"In matters of truth and justice, there is no difference between large and small problems, for issues concerning the treatment of people are all the same."
26,"As far as I'm concerned, I prefer silent vice to ostentatious virtue."
19,"I wish to do something Great and Wonderful, but I must start by doing the little things like they were Great and Wonderful"
8,Empathy is patiently and sincerely seeing the world through the other person's eyes. It is not learned in school; it is cultivated over a lifetime.
14,"Strange is our situation here on earth. Each of us comes for a short visit, not knowing why, yet sometimes seeming to divine a purpose."
3,I have become an obstinate heretic in the eyes of my colleagues. Momentary success carries more power of conviction than reflections upon principles.
25,Politics is more difficult than physics.
106,"I am a Jew, but I am enthralled by the luminous figure of the Nazarene….No one can read the Gospels without feeling the actual presence of Jesus."
9,"Thus I came...to a deep religiosity, which, however, reached an abrupt end at the age of 12. Through the reading of popular scientific books I soon reached a conviction that much in the stories of the Bible could not be true....Suspicion against every kind of authority grew out of this experience...an attitude which has never left me."
